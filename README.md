ID412 Introduction to Game Design and Theories 
Course OverviewGames   are   more   than   a   form   of entertainment   and   provide   invaluable   insights   into   human   nature   by   reflecting their   thoughts,       experiences, and desires, which conveys ones   ’ understanding and   engagement   with   the   worlds   around   them.   Throughout   the   course,    students   will   learn   varieties of   essential   aspects   in game   development   including   game mechanics   and   interactions, materials   and user   interfaces, level designs and others.   In   addition,   students will   gain   a practical   and   hands-on   knowledge   how to   employ   an   industry   standard   game   engine to   develop   a   game. Finally,   students will   deliver      an   individual    and/or team-based final comprehensive game prototypes.
Course Goals 
Upon completion of   this course, students   should be   able to:
●       Examine the games   ’   persuasive   and   educative potential   and   games   ’   roles   in   education,   training,   and other real-world applications
●       Analyze games critically   through   evaluating   their   strengths   and   weaknesses   from both   technical and narrative perspectives
●       Evaluate the mechanics,   dynamics,   and   aesthetics   of   games
●       Understand the industry-standard   game   engine’s interfaces   and   features
●       Apply the basic   game   engine   scripting to   develop   a   game
